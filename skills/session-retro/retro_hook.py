"""session-retro — a Stop hook that harvests improvement issues, ONCE per session.

THE CENTRAL PROBLEM this script exists to solve:

    A Claude Code "Stop" hook does NOT fire at session end. It fires at EVERY
    turn boundary — every single time the agent finishes a response. A retro
    that fires on every Stop fires dozens of times an hour and is pure spam.

So the whole job of this file is de-duplication: fire the retrospective AT MOST
ONCE per session (or once per N hours), and make every other Stop in that session
a silent no-op. Two independent guards do it:

    1. `stop_hook_active` — Claude Code sets this true on the Stop that was itself
       triggered by a previous blocking hook. If it's true, we already fired and
       the model is mid-retro; exit 0 immediately (also prevents an infinite loop).
    2. a per-session marker file — durable across the reset of `stop_hook_active`.
       If the marker for this session_id exists, we've fired; exit 0.

FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS. A retro hook that wedges an agent's stop is worse than no
retro. Every error path — bad stdin, missing jq/keys, unwritable state dir,
anything — ends in `exit 0` with NO output, so the stop proceeds normally. The
hook only ever *blocks* on the one deliberate, de-duplicated path.

Mechanism for soliciting the retro: on the fire path we print
`{"decision":"block","reason": <prompt>}` to stdout and exit 0. Claude Code feeds
`reason` back to the model as one more turn — the model runs the retro and files
the improvement issues itself (see file_improvement.py / the SKILL). The Stop that
follows *that* turn is caught by guard 1 and/or guard 2, so it does not re-fire.

Stdlib only. No dependencies. Config is env vars (see the SKILL / --help note).
