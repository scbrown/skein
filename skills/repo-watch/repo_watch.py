"""repo-watch — the deterministic half of a watch pass.

The SKILL.md carries the procedure an agent follows. This module carries the parts
that must be the SAME every pass, because they are the parts a careful agent gets
wrong differently each time: how a repo's owner is resolved from the graph, what
counts as a duplicate of an existing bead, and what the flood cap does when a pass
finds more than it is allowed to mint.

Design notes that are load-bearing, not decoration:

* **No network or filesystem I/O.** Text in, data out; invalid sweep setup warns. The agent
  runs the HTTP and git; this module only builds queries and judges results. That is
  what makes the whole thing testable offline, which is the skein convention.

* **No internal identifiers.** Hosts, namespaces, repo names and owners arrive as
  arguments resolved at run time. Nothing internal is baked in — this file ships to a
  public mirror.

    Three properties of this query are deliberate and each one was paid for:

    1. **Bidirectional alias closure.** For each ownership assertion, check
       whether ``(owl:sameAs|^owl:sameAs)*`` reaches an exact label or altLabel.
       Zero hops preserves direct ownership; either direction supports one-way
       knots without writing inverse edges or relying on materialisation.
       FILTER EXISTS seeds each traversal with its ownership entity. A path
       joined to a label UNION can instead expand the whole graph on the target
       endpoint, even for a missing label.

    2. **DISTINCT.** Denormalisation means a name frequently matches BOTH the label
       and an altLabel of the same entity, so the un-deduplicated form returns the
       same owner two or three times. Nothing is wrong when that happens, but a
       caller counting rows would read it as ambiguity.

    3. **OPTIONAL on state and remotes.** A repo with an owner but no recorded
       ownership state must still resolve. Making these required turns a partially
       described repo into an unresolvable one, which reads as "the resolver is
       broken" instead of "the graph is incomplete here".
